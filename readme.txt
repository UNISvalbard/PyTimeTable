 How it works:

The following calls use pywin32 to connect to Outlook while it is running.
This allows Python to tap into the Outlook calendar of the first email account.
Once tapped in, the functions below scan each calendar appointment for specific keywords in the title.
These keywords are based on the categories described in the UNIS Duty sheet for PhD students.

General naming convention to allow for this process:

{Category} - {Subcategory activity} - {WHO} / {description of task}

Please do not include dashes ("-") or forward slashes ("/") as part of the title other than those placed in the general naming convention.
